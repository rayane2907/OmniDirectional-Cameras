# Computer Vision Techniques for Non-Conventional Cameras

This repository explores the integration of computer vision techniques with non-conventional cameras, focusing on the conversion of 2D images to spherical coordinates. The project involves feature detection and matching between 2D and spherical images using homography matrices.

## Key Features

- **Feature Detection**: Utilizes methods such as Harris corner detection and SIFT to identify features in both 2D and spherical images.
- **Homography Matrices**: Computes homography matrices to establish geometric mappings between 2D and spherical image domains.
- **Coordinate Transformation**: Converts Cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates to facilitate seamless transitions between different imaging perspectives.
- **Feature Matching**: Matches features in the spherical image space to identify common features across different representations.
- **Implementation in MATLAB**: Includes MATLAB code snippets demonstrating the implementation of feature detection, homography computation, and coordinate transformation steps.

  Install MATLAB and ensure the required toolboxes (e.g., Image Processing Toolbox) are available.
